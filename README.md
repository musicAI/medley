## Environment
* Python 3.7
* TensorFlow 1.2.0
* NumPy 1.14.3
* LibROSA 0.6.2
* Pydub 0.22.1

There are already three sample audio clips in the `data` folder. You can directly run the code.

    $ git clone https://github.com/remyhuang/music-puzzle-games.git
    $ cd music-puzzle-games
    $ python main.py
   
## Use
The sample audio files (`mp3 format`) in the `data_raw` are from the raw dataset used in paper Generating Music Medleys via Playing Music Puzzle Games

Replace the sample audio files (`mp3 format`) in the `data_test` for your own purpose.
(Noted: Due to using the brute-force method to find the best permutation, the total number of audio files __should not exceed 11__.)

## Output
Three default output files:
* __best_permutation.txt__: the best permutation calculated by pairwise similarities
* __output.csv__: pairwise similarities 
* __output.mp3__: concatenated audio file of the best permutation
